PLEASE READ:
The user requested "Real Cute Cat Meows" instead of AI voices.
Since I cannot download copyrighted audio files for you, you need to add your own!

1. Download cute cat sounds (e.g. from Pixabay, Freesound, or YouTube).
2. Name them:
   - meow1.mp3
   - meow2.mp3
   - meow3.mp3
3. Place them in this folder (src/assets/).

The app is ALREADY coded to play these files randomly when you click the cat!
If no files are found, it will fall back to a default beep/chirp.
